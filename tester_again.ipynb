We make a table of values and hopefully find a rational zero (if we don't find a rational zero, this method does not work.) Assuming that c is a rational zero of the cubic function f(x), we can now factor f(x) = (x-c) · q(x), where q(x) is a quadratic. We can carry out this factorization using synthetic or long division. Then we factor the quadratic. For example, the rational zero test says that ifx³ + x - 2 has any rational zeros, they must be contained in the list ±1, ±2. By substituting these values, we find that x= 1 is a zero. Thus, x³ + x - 2 = (x-1)·q(x), where q(x) is a quadratic. Carrying out synthetic division, we find thatx³ + x - 2 = (x-1)·(x² + x + 2).
