True or False? The first step in solving a quadratic equation is to move the constant term to the right side. Then we factor x out of the left side.For example, we start to solve x² + 3x + 2 = 0 by rewriting it asx² + 3x = -2.Then we factor the left side:x(x + 3) = -2.	;
Check all approaches that may be used to factor a cubic.	Grouping. We factor x² out of the cubic and quadratic term. This may (but does not have to) produce x² times a linear term that is equal to the linear term of the cubic, or a constant multiple of it. For example, x³ + 5x² + x + 5 = x²(x+5) + x+5 = (x²+1)(x+5). x³ + 5x² + 7x + 35 = x²(x+5) + 7(x+5) = (x²+7)(x+5). This method only works in exceptional cases.
If the constant term of the cubic is zero, we factor out x and then factor the remaining quadratic. For example, x³ + 7x² + 6x  = 0 is equivalent to x(x² + 7x + 6) = 0, which is equivalent to x(x+1)(x+6) = 0. This means that the three solutions are x=0, x=-1 and x=-6.  
We use the rational zero test to determine a list of possible rational (including integer) solutions. We make a table of values and hopefully find a rational zero (if we don't find a rational zero, this method does not work.) Assuming that c is a rational zero of the cubic function f(x), we can now factor f(x) = (x-c) · q(x), where q(x) is a quadratic. We can carry out this factorization using synthetic or long division. Then we factor the quadratic. For example, the rational zero test says that ifx³ + x - 2 has any rational zeros, they must be contained in the list ±1, ±2. By substituting these values, we find that x= 1 is a zero. Thus, x³ + x - 2 = (x-1)·q(x), where q(x) is a quadratic. Carrying out synthetic division, we find thatx³ + x - 2 = (x-1)·(x² + x + 2). We can not find the remaining zeros by applying the quadratic formula to the quadratic.;
Several students were asked to formalize the following argument by defining appropriate predicates and then giving the argument as a numbered listed of statements. Each statement was to be labeled either as a premise, or a conclusion from earlier statements, and the argument form used identified.Vegetarians don't eat meat. Bill is a vegetarian. Pork is a kind of meat. Therefore, Bill does not eat pork.Identify the correct answer.	Ananya: define the predicates V(x) = "x is a vegetarian." M(y) = "y is meat."E(x,y) = "x eats y."The variable x represents people, the variable y represents foods. 1. ∀x,y (V(x) ∧ M(y)→ ¬E(x,y) )  (premise)2.
