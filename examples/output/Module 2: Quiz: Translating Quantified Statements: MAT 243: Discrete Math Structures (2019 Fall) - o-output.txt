Let P be the predicate defined by P(x,y) = "x owns y".Match each English statement with the corresponding formal expression that means the same thing. The phrase "public property" refers to an object that is owned by everyone.	Jane owns the house. --> P(Jane, house)

Josh doesn't own the cat. --> ¬P(Josh, cat)

(meaningless expression) --> P(Josh, ¬cat)

Everyone owns something. --> ∀x ∃y P(x,y)

Everything is owned by someone. --> ∀y ∃x P(x,y)

Some things don't have an owner. --> ∃y ∀x ¬P(x,y)

Some things are not public property. --> ∃y ∃x ¬P(x,y)

Some people own nothing. --> ∃x ∀y ¬P(x,y)

Some people don't own everything. --> ∃x ∃y ¬P(x,y)

Mr. Burns owns everything. --> ∀y P(Mr. Burns, y)

An object cannot have more than one owner. --> ∀x ∀y ∀z ( P(x,z) ∧ P(y,z) → x=y )

Some people own at most three things. --> ∃x ∃y ∃z ∃w ( P(x,y) ∧ P(x,z) ∧ P(x,w) ∧ ∀q ( P(x,q) → q=w ∨ q=y ∨q=z ) )

Some things have more than one owner. --> ∃y ∃x ∃z ( x ≠ z ∧P(x,y) ∧P(z,y) )

There is an object owned by everyone except one person. --> ∃y ∃x ( ¬P(x,y) ∧ ∀z ( z ≠ x → P(z,y) ) );
