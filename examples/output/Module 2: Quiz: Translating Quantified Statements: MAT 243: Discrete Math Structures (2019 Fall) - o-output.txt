Let P be the predicate defined by P(x,y) = "x owns y".Match each English                              statement with the corresponding formal expression that means the same thing.The phrase "public property" refers to an object that is owned by everyone.	Jane owns the house.. You selected P(Jane, house)
Josh doesn't own the cat.. You selected ¬P(Josh, cat)
(meaningless expression). You selected P(Josh, ¬cat)
Everyone owns something.. You selected ∀x ∃y P(x,y)
Everything is owned by someone.. You selected ∀y ∃x P(x,y)
Some things don't have an owner.. You selected ∃y ∀x ¬P(x,y)
Some things are not public property.. You selected ∃y ∃x ¬P(x,y)
Some people own nothing.. You selected ∃x ∀y ¬P(x,y)
Some people don't own everything.. You selected ∃x ∃y ¬P(x,y)
Mr. Burns owns everything.. You selected ∀y P(Mr. Burns, y)
An object cannot have more than one owner.. You selected ∀x ∀y ∀z ( P(x,z) ∧ P(y,z) → x=y )
Some people own at most three things.. You selected ∃x ∃y ∃z ∃w ( P(x,y) ∧ P(x,z) ∧ P(x,w) ∧ ∀q ( P(x,q) → q=w ∨ q=y ∨q=z ) )
Some things have more than one owner.. You selected ∃y ∃x ∃z ( x ≠ z ∧P(x,y) ∧P(z,y) )
There is an object owned by everyone except one person.. You selected ∃y ∃x ( ¬P(x,y) ∧ ∀z ( z ≠ x → P(z,y) ) );
