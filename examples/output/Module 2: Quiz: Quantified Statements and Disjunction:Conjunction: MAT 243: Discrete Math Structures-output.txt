In this exercise, let P and Q be predicates. Mark all statements that must be true, no matter what P and Q are.	If P(x) is true for all x or Q(x) is true for all x, then Px()∨Q(x) is true for all x
Mark all true statements.	If P(x)∨Q(x) is true for some x, then P(x) is true for some x, or Q(x) is true for some x
