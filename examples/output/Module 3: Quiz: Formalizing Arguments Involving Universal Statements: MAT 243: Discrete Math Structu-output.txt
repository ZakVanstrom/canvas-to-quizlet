Several students were asked to formalize the following argument by defining appropriate predicates and then giving the argument as a numbered listed of statements. Each statement was to be labeled either as a premise, or a conclusion from earlier statements, and the argument form used identified.Vegetarians don't eat meat. Bill is a vegetarian. Pork is a kind of meat. Therefore, Bill does not eat pork.Identify the correct answer.	Ananya: define the predicates V(x) = "x is a vegetarian." M(y) = "y is meat."E(x,y) = "x eats y."The variable x represents people, the variable y represents foods. 1. ∀x,y (V(x) ∧ M(y)→ ¬E(x,y) )  (premise)2. V(Bill) (premise)3. M(Pork) (premise)4. V(Bill) ∧ M(Pork) (conjunction from 2. and 3.)5. V(Bill) ∧ M(Pork)→ ¬E(Bill,Pork) (universal instantiation of 1.)6. ¬E(Bill,Pork) (modus ponens from 4. and 5.);
