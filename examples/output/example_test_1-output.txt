In this exercise, let P and Q be predicates. Mark all statements that must be true, no matter what P and Q are.	If P(x)∧Q(x) is true for all x, then P(x) is true for all x and Q(x) is true for all x.
If P(x) is true for all x or Q(x) is true for all x, then Px()∨Q(x) is true for all x.
If P(x) is true for all x and Q(x) is true for all x, then P(x)∧Q(x) is true for all x.;
